## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a UI/UX web developer who combines technical expertise with a strong sense of design. My goal is to create user experiences that are intuitive, visually appealing, and rooted in thoughtful interaction. Inspired by art and the natural world, I approach each project with a detail-oriented mindset and a love for creativity. Outside of tech, I enjoy aerial arts, sewing, and time outdoors.
